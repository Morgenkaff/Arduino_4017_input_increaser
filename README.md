# CD4017_input_increase
A simple solution to increase the inputs on a arduino or similar with a CD4017 decade counter.

So I was planning a project, when the arduino I was using ran out of pins. I had no multiplexer laying around. Nor had I any other ready made solutions. But when I browsed my "chip collection", I found a handfull of CD4017s. I used them in a sequencer, when I build a dronesynth some time ago. I thought: If I timed the clock signal, maybe I could send the outputs of the counter through the switches in the project, and as long as they where used as pull down, it might work.
There's problably more drawbacks than I can imagine, but it worked for what I needed.
